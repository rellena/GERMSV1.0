GERMS V1.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This update has major changes:

1) We have motion!! It is a simple triangle that moves along the screen,
but it moves!!!! This is implemented using opengl.

2) The mouselistener is no longer a class but rather just a cpp file that
contains the mouselisten functions and variables. Had to do this in order to
get it to work with opengl.

3) The main class now prints a triangle and the triangle will move until the centroid
of the triangle hits the target position IE: the mouse click.

4) Lots of opengl functions were added that aid with the animation.

	-DOUBLE buffering is now used, one buffer is printed while
	-the other is written to.


	-THE AXIS FOR DRAWING are now to scale of the window. That means
	-we can enter the actual cartesean coordinates instead of a relative
	-scale for the drawing and placement of objects. 

		THIS MAKES MOVEMENT MUCH EASIER

5) The move function in the unit class is up to date and more efficient.
